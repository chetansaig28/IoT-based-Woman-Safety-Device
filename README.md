# IoT-based-Woman-Safety-Device
The most pressing issue in our community
now is violence and discrimination against women, which
seems to be only rising despite all awareness. Statistics show
that India, which perceives itself as a promising superpower
and industrial centre, is nonetheless enslaved by different
patriarchal evils. As a result, women’s safety has become a
big concern, as they are afraid to leave their homes at any
moment for fear of abuse or violence, and are trapped in
spite of having huge potentials. In an attempt to combat
such threat, we propose a novel technique to women’s safety
by harnessing the power of Internet of Things and Machine
Learning.
